The Book of Monster Recipes	This leather-bound recipe book appears to be aimed at adventurers who aren't satified with merely fighting monsters and taking their treasure. It features a mixed selection of recipies, with side-notes on how best to prepare the remains of each creature included. "Braized Dragon Liver and Onions", "Eye of the Beholder Soup", "Rust Monster Jerky" and "Gelatinous Cube Jelly" are particular standouts.
Unspoiled Golden Apples	A bowl full of golden apples found in the midst of ruins which have long been left desolate and uninhabited. They are quite edible and unspoiled. If they are taken beyond the ruins, they will lose their golden sheen and appear ' in all respects ' as normal, red apples. So long as they remain within the ruins, however, they are golden, and will not age or rot.
Vials of Oil	Seventy-three clay vials of oil (1 pint each).

White Marble Ball	A small ball of white marble ' roughly three inches across ' which hovers in the air until it is touched or disturbed, at which point it falls to the floor and ceases to exhibit any supernatural properties.
Wrought Iron Sign	A large, wrought-iron sign crafted to read: 'Beware of Wyvern' in a bold script.
Zombie Dust	A small, brown glass jar, sealed with wax, with a gray dust inside. A white label is affixed to the jar, and reads: 'Zombie Dust' in a shaky script. (It is zombie dust.)

Drunkard's Hat	A simple straw hat.
Leather Armor	The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.
Padded Armor	Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.
Studded Armor	Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.
Hide Armor	This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.
Breastplate Armor	This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.
Half Plate Armor	Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.
Chain Shirt Armor	Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.
Scale Mail Armor	This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
Ring Mail Armor	This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.
Plate Armor	Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.
Chain Mail Armor	Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
Splint Armor	This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.
Shield	A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand.
Ammo Belt	This shoulder belt is ideally suited for holding sling bullets, darts, arrows or bolts.
Alchemist's Fire	This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
Silver Ring	A simple silver ring that bears no inscription or identifying marks on it's surface.
Sharpening Sheath	A dagger sheath of hardened leather, set with a number of cheap decorative stones. Any dagger kept within this sheath is automatically sharpened as if it were a fresh blade.
Frosted Dagger	A simple dagger with a blue hilt. The blade is almost always covered in frost.
