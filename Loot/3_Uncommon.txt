Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty. You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named. Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn. 
Allmagic Scrolls	These pieces of unweatherd, thick parchment are lined by a thin string of gold woven into the paper. To anyone who cannot read magic, they are always blank and featureless. However, someone who can read magic realizes that these scrolls can contain spell charges�of ANY type of spell, rather than just Arcane. Paladins, Clerics, and Druids, rejoice! Two charges of the spell must be spent to write one to the scroll, and some scrolls might be found with magic already written to them. These scrolls, once written to, can be cast free of charge�but the scroll is consumed in the process. Store those odd utility spells on Allmagic Scrolls, and never waste an unused daily charge again!

Aumurille's Chest	A miniature golden chest with tiny emeralds lining the top that trace out a mage�s sigil. The chest is crafted in exquisite detail. (This is the material component of a �Secret Chest� (from the spell of the same name) for the ruthless lady-mage Aumurille, who will likely want it back....)
Bag of Holding	This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened. 
Bag of Saffron	A small bag of saffron. It can be used to flavor the parties travel rations, but is probably more valuable as a trade good.
Bag of Tricks, Grey	"This ordinary gray cloth bag appears to be empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag�s color. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag cannot be used again until the next dawn.

These bracers are sometimes offered as rewards for services rendered by the Drow. The recipient, believing them to be very powerful, will often don them before examinating them.

However, after several decades he became so lonely that he chose to make a friend... literally. Using what little non-component materials he had laying around his tower, he created a small cube and gave it sentience. It was able to communicate telepathically with anyone who made a link with the cube. Unfortunately, the wizard eventually died and the cube became lonely. Unable to travel and find a new friend, the cube simply sat there and waited for anyone to come along. Anyone seeing the cube would be compelled to be with the cube and have it in their possession. Upon holding the cube, they would feel the need to keep it with them at all times, and protect it as if it were their own child. Little by little, the connection between the cube and it's possessor would grow, until the two would be inseparable.

Townshend's Cudgel	"Townshend's Crudgels was invented by its namesake, Peter ""Unknown"" Townshend, a traveling bard who wished his lute to both give beauty and take it away (preferably with a good old fashioned thrashing). His lute design, later copied by some of his admirers, was a simple oak lute, reinforced with an iron shell, to maintain the soft vibration of the sound against the wooden interior, and to give the lute the strength to crack open an orc's skull with a well placed blow.
This weapon functions both as a lute and a weapon. When used as a lute, it is considered to be a lute and does not require a separate proficiency bonus to play. However, if the user rolls a critical miss with the weapon (a 1 on an attack roll) the lute may become slightly damaged and will require the user to spend an hour to retune it.

Researching it's history will reveal that this is, in fact, one of many created by a local wizard who was frustrated at being unable to throw a normal boomerang in such a way that it returned naturally.
